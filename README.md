# Beverage Management System

## **Project overview**


This web application aids in mobile inventory system management. The frontend of the mobile device shows a stream of things being displayed; a deep learning model uses this data to identify the objects and automatically update the inventory list's frontend display with the most recent inventory count.

● Using state of the art Yolov5 model with detection speed as low as 5ms per frame.

● Built the frontend using Streamlit.

● Using SQLite3 as a Database for managing inventory. .

Utilizing streamlit_webrtc, which facilitates real-time communication, we will be able to detect images in real time by executing detections on the frames captured from the real-time video in the backend.
You could also use drag-and-drop or image upload to carry out detections on images, as seen below.Using three fields — Date, Beverage Name, and Count — we are storing results on our sqlite database, which aids the end user in maintaining inventory and verifying quantities day to day. as shown below
